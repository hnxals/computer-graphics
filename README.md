# computer-graphics
the assignments of computer graphics

The Lab1 folder actually includes 5 labs.   
The lab taught me how the computer graphics API works.  
We cannot use any existing opengl API other than the drawline in all the labs.  


1. Lab 1 needs us to read nodes in .d file, then use drawline api to draw the shape of model.  
here are the description and the images which I wrote down in the discussions of BlackBoard.

2. Lab 2 needs us to implement the z-buffer algorithm, and color every polygon for different color.  
This one will use scan line algorithm and the Z-buffer algorithm. Here are the images I wrote before.

3. Lab 3 needs us to augment assignment 2 by implementing three shading algorithms(constant, Gouraud, and Phong). Use Phong specular illumination model.   
I remember The phong shading is very complex, cost me much time to do this lab. Here are the result images.

4. Lab 4 needs us to augment assignment 3 by adding textures. I used projective texture map.

5. We can do any think in lab 5. I choosed to generate random textures by using perlin noise.   
The project will save the RGB info into a 500X500 BMP file which named "texture.bmp", then use my previous lab-4 to read and show the texture on the house.
